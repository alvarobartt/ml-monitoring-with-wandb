## :open_file_folder: Dataset

The dataset that is going to be used to train the image classification model is 
"[The Simpsons Characters Data](https://www.kaggle.com/alexattia/the-simpsons-characters-dataset)", 
which is Kaggle dataset that contains images of some of the main The Simpsons characters.

The original dataset contains 42 classes of The Simpsons characters, with an unbalanced number of samples per 
class, and a total of 20,935 training images and 990 test images in JPG format.

## :computer: Credits

Credits for the dataset to [Alexandre Attia](https://github.com/alexattia) for creating it, as well as the Kaggle
community that made it possible, as they included a lot of images to the original dataset (from 20 characters to 
up to 42).
